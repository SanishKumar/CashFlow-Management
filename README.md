# CashFlow Minimization using Max Heap Data Structure

 In an interconnected world where financial transactions are
 ubiquitous, managing and minimizing debts can become an intricate
 challenge. This project focuses on the problem of CashFlow
 minimization, drawing inspiration from a computational problem
 and a real-world application.
 The problem statement for this project is derived from 
Codeforces
 problem 1266D - Decreasing Debts. The scenario involves a group
 of nnn individuals, each engaging in various financial transactions
 that sometimes necessitate borrowing and lending money. Over
 time, the network of debts becomes complex, necessitating a
 method to consolidate and minimize these debts to simplify
 financial management and reduce the total number of transactions.
 This project also takes inspiration from the 
Splitwise app, a popular
 tool for tracking and managing expenses among groups. Splitwise
 helps users keep track of their financial transactions, ensuring
 everyone pays their fair share while minimizing the complexity of
 individual debts.
 To address this problem, we employ heap data structures to
 optimize the process of debt minimization. By leveraging heaps, we
 can efficiently manage and reduce the number of transactions
 needed to settle all debts, ensuring a streamlined and simplified
 financial network.
 The project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the vis.js library to
 create an intuitive and interactive visualization of the debt
 minimization process. This visualization allows users to easily
 understand and follow the steps involved in consolidating debts,
 providing a clear and educational representation of the underlying
 algorithm.
 In summary, this project aims to provide an efficient solution for
 CashFlow minimization, inspired by a complex computational
 problem and a practical financial application. Through the use of
 advanced data structures and interactive visualization, we offer a
 tool that simplifies debt management and enhances financial clarity.
